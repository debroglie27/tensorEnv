## Welcome to My 'PDF Merger App':
This App is used to merge pdf files easily by specifying the page range  
for each pdf file, and the sequence of merging can also be adjusted accordingly.

### Basic View:
This is how the App looks.

**We can**:
* Add files and Remove files using the Menu Buttons on top.
* Change the sequence of the files being added using the *Move Up* and *Move Down* Button.
* Change the Page Range by increasing or decreasing the *First Page* and *Last Page* value.
* Merge the pdf files using the *Merge Button*.

### THE END
Thank You for going through my *PDF Merger App*.
