This particular folder contains python related things which I learned   
from a Youtuber named Tim.

### Udemy_Games:
This folder contains games developed in Python using **Pygame**  
or just Python. All are simple **2D Games** which can be  
a lot of fun while playing them.

> also I don't want to change it so please don't get confused.
